            In the summer of 2022, I was hired as the Graphic Design Intern at <a href="https://www.climaterealityproject.org/">The Climate Reality Project</a>(CR). Within the Communications team, under the mentorship of the Creative Director, Rebecca Roesler, I received hands-on training in all things Graphic Design.
